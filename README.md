Version 1   


My first solo project! Had a great time learning on my own and handling the challenges of full autonomy. 

This website shows movies and tv series with the info being drawn from the [_The Movie Database_ (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API

* The frontend was built using React and pure CSS. Global state was managed through React Context
* 
* The backend was built using NodeJS, ExpressJS and PostgreSQL. User authentication was handled through Passport using a local strategy

Currently working on version 2
